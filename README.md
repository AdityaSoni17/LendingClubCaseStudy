## Conclusions
- The analysis revealed several key insights, including:
    1. Demographic Trends: Certain demographic groups exhibited higher loan approval rates and default rates.
    2. Impact of Credit Score: Credit scores were strongly correlated with loan approval and the likelihood of default.
    3. Loan Purpose: Different purposes for loans influenced approval rates and average loan amounts.
    4. Geographical Patterns: Variations in loan performance were observed across different regions.
    5. Recommendations: Suggestions for improving loan application processes and risk assessment strategies based on findings.
